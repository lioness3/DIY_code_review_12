# _Instructions for Code Review Assignment_
* Endpoints for GET (all and by id), POST, PUT and DELETE.
* A RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.
* A second custom endpoint that accepts parameters (example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names).
* Model scopes to process parameters from API calls.
* At least one of the objectives from Monday's Further Exploration lesson (such as versioning, token authentication, or serialization).
* Thorough exception handling.
* Complete testing with request specs.
* Randomized data with Faker or your own custom seed code.
* A README that thoroughly documents all endpoints, including parameters that can be passed in.
